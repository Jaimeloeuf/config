# Config / rc files
A collection of my personal program config files, and rc files used on my linux systems.
Feel free to use these files however you like :)

rc files can mean the following in unix/unix-like systems:
1.	Runtime Configuration
2.	Run commands
3.	Resource control

- .vimrc
- .bashrc
- .bash_aliases
